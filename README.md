## Hi, this is Yiming (Ryan) Shen 👋 

🎓 MDSAI (Co-op) @ University of Waterloo  |  Bachelor of STAT (Co-op) @ University of Waterloo

📍 Toronto, Canada

🚀 About Me

I am a Master of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (MDSAI) student at the University of Waterloo with a strong background in Statistics and Computing.

My work focuses on building robust, leakage-aware, and reproducible machine learning systems, particularly in time-series modeling and applied ML for real-world decision-making.

I enjoy:

Translating messy, high-dimensional data into structured modeling pipelines

Bridging theory (statistics / ML) with practical deployment

Communicating technical insights to non-technical stakeholders


🧩 What I Care About

I am particularly interested in:

AI Engineering

LLM & NLP

Computer Vision

Time-Series Forecasting

Long term, I aim to work across the full ML lifecycle — from feature engineering and modeling to deployment and monitoring.


🤝 Let’s Connect

If you're working on interesting ML/AI problems or building intelligent systems, I would love to connect.
